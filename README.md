# MidiDriver
MIDI synthesizer for android (soundfont2 is supported)

â“˜ This is a fork of [KyoSherlock/MidiDriver](https://github.com/KyoSherlock/MidiDriver) with the following changes:

- Gradle and dependencies have been updated
- [`javax.sound.midi`](https://github.com/kshoji/javax.sound.midi-for-Android) is no longer directly copied into this project but is instead added as a dependency
- Migrated from `android.support` to `androidx`
- This library has been published to this Git repository; to use it:

  1. In `build.gradle` in your Android project, add this to the `repositories` section, e.g.

     ```
     allprojects {
         repositories {
             ...
             maven { url 'https://github.com/bmaupin/MidiDriver/raw/master/repo' }
         }
     }
     ```

  1. In `app/build.gradle` in your Android project, add this library as a dependency, e.g.

     ```
     dependencies {
       ...
       implementation 'cn.sherlock:sherlockmidi:1.0'
     ```

  1. Use this library in your project; see the `sample` directory for an example
