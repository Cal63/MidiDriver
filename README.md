# MidiDriver
MIDI synthesizer for android (soundfont2 is supported)

â“˜ This is a fork of [KyoSherlock/MidiDriver](https://github.com/KyoSherlock/MidiDriver) with the following changes:

- Gradle and dependencies have been updated
- [`javax.sound.midi-for-Android`](https://github.com/kshoji/javax.sound.midi-for-Android) is no longer directly copied into this project but is instead added as a dependency
  - `javax.sound.midi-for-Android` has also been updated to the latest version; [previously it was using an older version from 2017](https://github.com/KyoSherlock/MidiDriver/tree/master/sherlockmidi/src/main/java/jp/kshoji/javax/sound/midi)
- Migrated from `android.support` to `androidx`
- This library has been published to JitPack; to use it:

  1. In `build.gradle` in your Android project, add this to the `repositories` section, e.g.

     ```groovy
     allprojects {
         repositories {
             // ...
             maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
         }
     }
     ```

  1. In `app/build.gradle` in your Android project, add this library and `javax.sound.midi-for-Android` as dependencies, e.g.

     ```groovy
     dependencies {
       // ...
       implementation 'com.github.bmaupin:javax.sound.midi-for-Android:fix-jitpack-build-SNAPSHOT'
       implementation 'com.github.bmaupin:MidiDriver:1.0'
     }
     ```
